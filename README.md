TABConf - The Atlanta Bitcoin Conference — an event for building communities, providing education, and supporting developers. We like to think of this as the most inclusive, organic, grassroots event possible for Bitcoin.

# What can I expect at TABConf?

- Great Speakers: Talks and panels with some of the brightest minds in Bitcoin.
- Villages: Mini conferences within TABConf organized by people in the Bitcoin community. TABConf does not dictate any of the content or activities.
- Workshops: Hands-on workshops that will teach you how to develop with the latest Bitcoin libraries and apps.
- Builder Day: Meet the people who build your favorite open-source Bitcoin projects, and learn how to become a FOSS contributor yourself.
- Capture the Bitcoin: This conference-wide scavenger hunt will test your knowledge of Bitcoin as you compete to be the first to steal real Bitcoin!
- Chess Tournament: Chess tournament. 100k sats buy-in, winner, take all! Single-round elimination for winners. Losers battle it out for the worst player in a “loser stay bracket.”
