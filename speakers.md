# TABConf 2023 Call for Speakers Open

We are organizing the TABConf 2023 programming a bit differently, its exciting. 

If you are interested in giving a talk, workshop, or panel, you must open a GitHub issue in the 
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/TABConf/2023.tabconf.com/issues/new/choose">repo</a>. 
You do NOT need to be a developer to open a GitHub Issue for a talk, workshop, or panel submission. You only need a GitHub profile and some time.

Please be as detailed as possible when opening your issue because this is how talks, panels, and workshops for TABConf 2023 will be selected. Your submission is public, so anyone can also read your submission, ask questions, and vote on it by using the emojis on Github. 

Here is a great example issue you can check out: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/TABConf/2023.tabconf.com/issues/34">workshop example</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/TABConf/2023.tabconf.com/issues/96">talk example</a>.

Submissions that are chosen will be added to the TABConf 2023 GitHub Project, which is what we are going to use as our: 
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/orgs/TABConf/projects/1">official schedule</a>.

Here are some of the reasons we are trying this out for 2023.
- We want to provide more transparency for the workshop, speaker, and panel selections. 
- We want attendees to have the ability to ask questions and have conversations about the submissions before the conference
- We want to push attendees to research submissions by reviewing GitHub repos before they attend TABConf. 
- We want to keep TABConf a technically-focused conference, and pushing attendees to GitHub may help people learn about the different projects and repos in the space.
